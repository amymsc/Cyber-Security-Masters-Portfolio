            <h3>Unit Summary</h3>
            <p>This unit covered the fundamentals of research ethics and the scientific method, focusing on the purposes of research—exploration, description, and explanation. It taught me about the differences between deductive and inductive reasoning, their applications in research, and the significance of each approach in various scenarios. As part of the unit, I took a reasoning test to ensure I understood the differences. A substantial emphasis is placed on understanding and adhering to research ethics, guided by principles such as respect, beneficence, justice, and legal compliance. The unit also addresses professional conduct in research, particularly in the fields of Computer Science, underscoring the importance of data protection and intellectual property. Within the unit, I completed a Seminar activity and submitted a collaborative discussion post. </p>

            <h3>Unit Summary</h3>
            <p>In unit 2, I had my first leturecast of the module covering research questions, the literature review, and the research proposal. In this module, I am required to complete a literature review and submit a research proposal on a topic of my choice. I decided to do my literature review on the ways digital transformation could improve the NHS as I used to work within the organisation and had first hand experience of how outdated the systems are. I also believe it would be an interesting area. I looked over the research questions this week and although they can be used to narrow down your topic, I knew I wanted to keep it quite broad as I wanted to leave room for any interesting information I researched throughout this module. During this unit, I also replied to some discussion posts and received some replies to help me work on my final summary post.  </p>

            <h3>Unit Summary</h3>
            <p>Unit 3 provided me with a clearer understanding of the essential components required for formulating effective research strategies. This unit centered around Research Design, a concept defined by Saunders et al. (2012) as the planning of data collection and analysis methods to answer research questions. We delved into two primary types of research designs: Exploratory Research, which focuses on investigating less defined areas, illustrated by a case study on Customer Relationship Management in mobile marketing; and Conclusive Research, aimed at validating insights for decision-making, like an analysis of social media in marketing strategies. This unit also covered the three main research methods - Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Research, highlighting their unique data collection techniques. A significant part of the learning involved differentiating between primary and secondary research methods. This knowledge has equipped me with an ability to identify a method for my own research. Looking at the benefits of both types, I believe a mixed method approch would be best for my research within the nhs as both are possible in that environment. I aslo competed a summary post for the collaborative discussion this week.</p>

            <p>This unit explored essential data collection methods that can be employed in both qualitative and quantitative research. This week, I also worked on the outline for the literature review to be submitted in unit 7. I choose some paper that I found interesting on the topic to make nots and guide my review, focusing on positive change possibilities. </p>
            <h3>Data Collection Methods</h3>
            <p><b>Case Studies</b><br>Case studies involve in-depth examination of individuals or groups, leading to hypotheses and a broader understanding of phenomena while cautioning against determining causation due to potential researcher bias and atypical respondents.</p>
            <p><b>Focus Groups</b><br>Focus groups provide a qualitative approach where 6-10 individuals with common backgrounds express insights to answer fundamental "why," "what," and "how" questions.</p>
            <p><b>Quantitative Observation</b><br>Quantitative observation focuses on numerical data collected objectively and analysed statistically, often through experiments or surveys.</p>
            <p><b>Qualitative Observation</b><br>Qualitative observation is centered on monitoring characteristics and behaviors of predetermined respondents in natural settings, offering in-depth insights.</p>

            <p>In unit 5,, I covered essential research methods: interviews, surveys, and pre- and post-testing. These tools provide valuable insights for various research scenarios. I've acquired practical skills to apply them effectively in our future investigations. I also took part in a reflective activity and continued working on my literature review.</p>

            <p>In this unit, I explored the creation of effective research tools. We started by understanding the distinction between a questionnaire and a survey, with the questionnaire being the building block of a survey. The unit emphasised the flexibility of questionnaires, their various administration methods, and the importance of choosing the right type of questions based on our research approach. I also learned to be mindful of common mistakes, particularly in technical fields. By the end of the unit, I gained the skills to differentiate between well-designed and poorly constructed questionnaires, preparing me to create some for reearch purposes. <br> I also undertook a further activity to practice improving a sruvey.</p>
