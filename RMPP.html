            <h3>Unit Summary</h3>
            <p>This unit covered the fundamentals of research ethics and the scientific method, focusing on the purposes of research—exploration, description, and explanation. It taught me about the differences between deductive and inductive reasoning, their applications in research, and the significance of each approach in various scenarios. As part of the unit, I took a reasoning test to ensure I understood the differences. A substantial emphasis is placed on understanding and adhering to research ethics, guided by principles such as respect, beneficence, justice, and legal compliance. The unit also addresses professional conduct in research, particularly in the fields of Computer Science, underscoring the importance of data protection and intellectual property. Within the unit, I completed a Seminar activity and submitted a collaborative discussion post. </p>

            <h3>Unit Summary</h3>
            <p>In unit 2, I had my first leturecast of the module covering research questions, the literature review, and the research proposal. In this module, I am required to complete a literature review and submit a research proposal on a topic of my choice. I decided to do my literature review on the ways digital transformation could improve the NHS as I used to work within the organisation and had first hand experience of how outdated the systems are. I also believe it would be an interesting area. I looked over the research questions this week and although they can be used to narrow down your topic, I knew I wanted to keep it quite broad as I wanted to leave room for any interesting information I researched throughout this module. During this unit, I also replied to some discussion posts and received some replies to help me work on my final summary post.  </p>

            <h3>Unit Summary</h3>
            <p>Unit 3 provided me with a clearer understanding of the essential components required for formulating effective research strategies. This unit centered around Research Design, a concept defined by Saunders et al. (2012) as the planning of data collection and analysis methods to answer research questions. We delved into two primary types of research designs: Exploratory Research, which focuses on investigating less defined areas, illustrated by a case study on Customer Relationship Management in mobile marketing; and Conclusive Research, aimed at validating insights for decision-making, like an analysis of social media in marketing strategies. This unit also covered the three main research methods - Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Research, highlighting their unique data collection techniques. A significant part of the learning involved differentiating between primary and secondary research methods. This knowledge has equipped me with an ability to identify a method for my own research. Looking at the benefits of both types, I believe a mixed method approch would be best for my research within the nhs as both are possible in that environment. I aslo competed a summary post for the collaborative discussion this week.</p>

            <h3>Unit Summary</h3>
            <p>Unit 4 centered on exploring the intricacies of the threat modeling manifesto, the OWASP cookbook, and the Mitre ATT&CK database. Notably, I derived great satisfaction from the seminar activity offered in this unit. This practical exercise provided me with an opportunity to leverage the knowledge acquired from previous units and apply threat modeling principles to a real-world scenario. The experience proved to be both enjoyable and enlightening, enabling me to witness firsthand the practical application of threat modeling in a tangible context.</p>
            <h3>Team Work Summary</h3>
            <p>This week, all the work completed in the last week was looked at and discussed. Team members provided tips and said they will look over each other’s work before the next meeting. The future network was discussed, and the second section of work was split up. The aim was to complete part 1 and most of part 2 before the next meeting. </p>

            <p>Unit 7 provided me with valuable knowledge regarding quantitative risk modeling (QRM). I delved deeper into the subject and gained a thorough understanding of Monte Carlo Simulations and Bayes theorem. While I invested considerable time in comprehending Monte Carlo Simulations, I recognized the need to further enhance my knowledge, particularly for my upcoming assignment, which would involve more intricate and complex simulations. Nevertheless, I successfully completed some fundamental simulations, but I am aware of the need to expand my expertise in this area.</p>
            <h3>Team Work Summary</h3>
            <p>This week we discussed our feedback from the last report. A large bit of feedback was to ensure all assumptions were stated with justifications.

            <p>In this unit, the practical application of quantitative risk modeling (QRM) was showcased through real-world simulations, which were presented via case studies and scholarly journals. I participated in a seminar activity centered around the assigned readings, although I encountered a setback as I was unable to access one of the required materials, hindering my progress in that particular aspect. Nonetheless, I contributed to collaborative discussion 2, engaging in meaningful discourse with my peers. Furthermore, I dedicated continued effort to our ongoing team project, making progress on its development.</p>
            <h3>Team Work Summary</h3>
