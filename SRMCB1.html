      <h3>Initial Post</h3>
      <p>CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) is a standard framework used to access vulnerabilities and produce a numerical score based on several factors. In “Time to change CVSS?’, Spring et al (2021) criticize several characteristics of CVSS.
Firstly, the formula used for calculating the scores is said to lack proper justification. Additionally, they question the assumption of a linear relationship between CVSS scores, and risk and the statistical techniques used to derive numerical values from ordinal data. The argument is due to the system not accounting for any organisational context not the effects of vulnerabilities forming an exploit chain. Furthermore, there is the argument that CVSS scores should be seen as rankings rather than a truly quantitative technique as they are derived from ordinal data.
The authors criticisms align with research that found CVSS disregards the impact of vulnerabilities on business processes and organisational security (Vemuri et al, 2017). It has also been criticised that stating that CVSS is not a risk score, is not enough to stop it being perceived that way and used incorrectly (Howard, 2023).  CVSS is commonly used to guide companies to what vulnerabilities to patch and could be misleading as lower scores may indicate lower risk rather than a ranking.
One alternative to CVSS is the Risk Assessment Methodology for Critical Infrastructure Protection (RAMCIP) proposed by Kousiouris et al (2016). RAMCIP takes into account a broader range of factors, such as the value of assets, the likelihood of an attack, and the potential impact of a successful attack. By incorporating these factors, RAMCIP provides a more comprehensive and accurate risk assessment of vulnerabilities.
In conclusion, the critique of CVSS is valid, as it lacks justification for its formula, neglects important contextual factors, oversimplifies risks, and misconstrues its quantitative nature. Alternative approaches like RAMCIP offer a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of vulnerability risks. It is essential to address the limitations of CVSS and explore alternative methodologies to enhance the accuracy and usefulness of vulnerability severity assessments.
