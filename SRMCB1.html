      <h3>Initial Post</h3>
      <p>The fourth industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0, is characterised by new emergent technologies advancing industrial processes (Bai, 2020). These technologies include the use of artificial intelligence (AI), big data, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, machine learning (ML), cloud computing, and other progressive technologies (Koh, 2019¬). These technologies are increasing efficiency across industries and transforming how businesses operate, with many potential positive impacts.
      As more companies move towards digitalisation and the use of the new technologies described, there are risks to be aware of.  A business’s move to digitalisation will involve storing and sending information electronically, which leads to vulnerabilities that may have not been considered before. The risks outlined by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (Kovaitė, 2019) highlight the challenge of digitalisation. In particular, security and financial risks could lead to severe consequences if not actioned.
      There is a large cost to digitalisation that needs to be considered, with large upfront costs to implement the technologies required for digitalisation (Sotnyk, 2020). There are also staffing costs since new staff will need to be hired, such as cyber security professionals. A cyber-security attack could lead to larger costs if successful (Walters, 2015). Therefore, it is important a business can afford digitalisation.
      There are also many data security risks. A business will have to store data and transmit it securely. A business must manage to keep customer and business data secure to grow trust and avoid noncompliance with regulations (Keller, 2005).   
      Messa’s 2022 article discusses the impact of digitalisation regarding Industry 4.0, with a case study to back it up (Messa, 2022). This article provides advice and aims to help create a roadmap to digitalisation to help with risks of a similar nature to Kovaitė, 2019.  This article is limited to a single study but provides a good starting point for addressing digitalisation risks.
