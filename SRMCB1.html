      <h3>Initial Post</h3>
      <p>CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) is a standard framework used to access vulnerabilities and produce a numerical score based on several factors. In “Time to change CVSS?’, Spring et al (2021) criticize several characteristics of CVSS.
Firstly, the formula used for calculating the scores is said to lack proper justification. Additionally, they question the assumption of a linear relationship between CVSS scores, and risk and the statistical techniques used to derive numerical values from ordinal data. The argument is due to the system not accounting for any organisational context not the effects of vulnerabilities forming an exploit chain. Furthermore, there is the argument that CVSS scores should be seen as rankings rather than a truly quantitative technique as they are derived from ordinal data.
The authors criticisms align with research that found CVSS disregards the impact of vulnerabilities on business processes and organisational security (Vemuri et al, 2017). It has also been criticised that stating that CVSS is not a risk score, is not enough to stop it being perceived that way and used incorrectly (Howard, 2023).  CVSS is commonly used to guide companies to what vulnerabilities to patch and could be misleading as lower scores may indicate lower risk rather than a ranking.
One alternative to CVSS is the Risk Assessment Methodology for Critical Infrastructure Protection (RAMCIP) proposed by Kousiouris et al (2016). RAMCIP takes into account a broader range of factors, such as the value of assets, the likelihood of an attack, and the potential impact of a successful attack. By incorporating these factors, RAMCIP provides a more comprehensive and accurate risk assessment of vulnerabilities.
In conclusion, the critique of CVSS is valid, as it lacks justification for its formula, neglects important contextual factors, oversimplifies risks, and misconstrues its quantitative nature. Alternative approaches like RAMCIP offer a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of vulnerability risks. It is essential to address the limitations of CVSS and explore alternative methodologies to enhance the accuracy and usefulness of vulnerability severity assessments.

      <h3>Summary Post</h3>
      <p>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is widely used, serving to evaluate and prioritize the severity of vulnerabilities found in cyber systems. Through the assignment of a numerical score, CVSS establishes a standardised methodology for assessing these vulnerabilities. However, a comprehensive examination of the CVSS scoring method reveals several inherent flaws that have been highlighted during this discussion.One significant drawback lies in the unavoidable reliance on human interpretation and judgment in determining CVSS scores, thereby introducing the potential for inconsistencies (Spring et al, 2018). Despite its pursuit of objectivity, this aspect remains susceptible to subjective influences, casting doubt on the scoring reliability and uniformity. Moreover, the oversimplification of real-world systems is another noteworthy limitation. Concentrating primarily on the vulnerabilities themselves, the framework often fails to account for the intricate context and interdependencies of various system components (Fruwirth & Mannisto, 2009). Consequently, a more nuanced understanding of the complexity inherent in practical scenarios may be neglected, compromising the accuracy and comprehensiveness of vulnerability assessments (Spring et al, 2021). The static nature of CVSS scores can fall short of effectively gauging the genuine security risks faced by organizations, highlighting the need for supplementary methods.
While these limitations represent only a few instances of the flaws present within the CVSS scoring method, they underscore the importance of critical awareness when employing this framework. Recognising and acknowledging these shortcomings is imperative to mitigate potential pitfalls and augment decision-making processes related to cybersecurity. By integrating additional contextual information and leveraging expert insights, security professionals can bolster the effectiveness and relevance of vulnerability assessments in safeguarding systems and data.
