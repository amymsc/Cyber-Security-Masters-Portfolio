            <h3>Topic</h3>
            <p><b>ased on your reading of the case study(Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019) answer the following questions in the discussion forum:</b><br>
                .What do the authors mean by the term Industry 4.0 - give two examples.<br>
                .Give two real-world examples of risks that fit into the authors categories.<br>
                .Find another journal article that either supports or contradicts the points made in the cited study.</p>
            <h3>Initial Post</h3>
            <p>The fourth industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0, is characterised by new emergent technologies advancing industrial processes (Bai, 2020). These technologies include the use of artificial intelligence (AI), big data, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, machine learning (ML), cloud computing, and other progressive technologies (Koh, 2019¬). These technologies are increasing efficiency across industries and transforming how businesses operate, with many potential positive impacts.
                <br>As more companies move towards digitalisation and the use of the new technologies described, there are risks to be aware of.  A business’s move to digitalisation will involve storing and sending information electronically, which leads to vulnerabilities that may have not been considered before. The risks outlined by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (Kovaitė, 2019) highlight the challenge of digitilisation. In particular, security and financial risks could lead to severe consequences if not actioned.
                <br>There is a large cost to digitalisation that needs to be considered, with large upfront costs to implement the technologies required for digitalisation (Sotnyk, 2020). There are also staffing costs since new staff will need to be hired, such as cyber security professionals. A cyber-security attack could lead to larger costs if successful (Walters, 2015). Therefore, it is important a business can afford digitisation.
                <br>There are also many data security risks. A business will have to store data and transmit it securely. A business must manage to keep customer and business data secure to grow trust and avoid noncompliance with regulations (Keller, 2005).   
                <br>Messa’s 2022 article discusses the impact of digitalisation regarding Industry 4.0, with a case study to back it up (Messa, 2022). This article provides advice and aims to help create a roadmap to digitalisation to help with risks of a similar nature to Kovaitė, 2019.  This article is limited to a single study but provides a good starting point for addressing digitaliation risks.

            <h1>Security and Risk Management</h1>
            <p>This module analyzes the different areas where security and risk overlap and interact with each other. It examines the various methods of risk assessment, encompassing both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Several traditional risk models (such as STRIDE, DREAD, and Attack Trees) will be explored, along with an examination of the growing trend towards hybrid models. Additionally, common security standards like PCI-DSS will be reviewed, alongside an exploration of business continuity and disaster recovery solutions. Lastly, the module delves into significant research topics and advancements that are propelling the fields of security and risk management forward.</p>
            <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
            <p><b>On completion of this module I will be able to:</b></p>
            <p>Describe when to use qualitative and quantitative risk assessments.<br>Create threat models for various scenarios.
                <br>Create quantitative risk models.<br>Design and explain DR strategies and solutions.</p>

            <h3>Summary Post</h3>
            <p>This discussion has been extremely interesting and helped me to increase my knowledge through the insight from my peers.
                <br>Digitalisation and Industry 4.0 present both challenges and opportunities for small and micro-sized businesses. It can be difficult to keep up with the challenge of an ever-changing environment and it is important that there are experienced staff to lead and manage these technical challenges within a business.<br>
                <br>The advantages to such a change are endless, with digital solutions being more adaptable to change within the business environment, allowing a business to adapt quickly to maintain efficiency and therefore profits.<br>
                <br>There are also many disadvantages, with there often being a high cost to digitalisation. However, Steve highlighted that this is not the main factor that causes a business to struggle with digitalisation. Often the “fear of missing out” leads to a business moving too quickly, without a solid foundation for the digitisation process, leading to more problems further along the process and higher incurred costs (Nöhammer & Stichlberger, 2019).<br>
                <br>A business needs to have a strong plan and employees with cyber experience to manage the transition. If this is done incorrectly, breaches are more likely, and fines will be incurred. Sayam mentioned the Equifax data breach which led to a settlement of over $425 million (Federal Trade Commission, 2022). A loss like this could bankrupt a small business, highlighting the need for ensuring any digital solutions are secure.<br>
                <br>Despite the challenges involved with digitalisation and Industry 4.0, the benefits from these technologies lead me to believe that any business that can invest in these technologies should do so. They can enable the business to remain competitive in an ever-changing world and attract more customers (Matarazzo et al, 2021). The use of government grants and additional financing could help to accelerate the growth of smaller businesses (Price et al, 2018).<br>
