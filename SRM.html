            <h1>Security and Risk Management</h1>
            <p>This module analyzes the different areas where security and risk overlap and interact with each other. It examines the various methods of risk assessment, encompassing both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Several traditional risk models (such as STRIDE, DREAD, and Attack Trees) will be explored, along with an examination of the growing trend towards hybrid models. Additionally, common security standards like PCI-DSS will be reviewed, alongside an exploration of business continuity and disaster recovery solutions. Lastly, the module delves into significant research topics and advancements that are propelling the fields of security and risk management forward.</p>
            <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
            <p><b>On completion of this module I will be able to:</b></p>
            <p>Describe when to use qualitative and quantitative risk assessments.<br>Create threat models for various scenarios.
                    <br>Create quantitative risk models.<br>Design and explain DR strategies and solutions.</p>
